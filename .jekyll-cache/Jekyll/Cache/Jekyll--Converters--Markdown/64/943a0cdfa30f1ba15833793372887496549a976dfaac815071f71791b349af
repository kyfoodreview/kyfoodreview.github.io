I"¢<p>My favorite thing about cities, like Lexington, with good food scenes, is that you can find interesting places to eat in the most unassuming places. Pasta Garage is located on a small side street off of Winchester Road near the JIF Peanut Butter factory. While not on a road many would take often, this isnâ€™t a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. In fact, this restaurant seems to own the entire remodeled building.</p>
