I"1<p>Marrika’s has long been on my places in Lexington that I wanted to eat at. My first real experience at a German restaurant was at Hofbräuhaus in Newport, Kentucky which had great food, giant beers, and a very authentic beer hall inside. Needless to say, I had high expectations for Marikka’s.</p>
