<p>It was the first gorgeous spring weekend this year and I was out enjoying the day with a nice drive around Lexington. I ended up near Chinoe Road and thinking about where I might want to grab lunch I remembered there was an interesting looking Mexican restaurant near Kroger that I had wanted to try out for some time.</p>

<p>While Iâ€™ve certainly not yet eaten at every Mexican restaurant in Lexington, I think I can say with some confidence that this might be the best looking one in town. The whole restaurant is massive and painted in vibrant blue, yellow, and red. On a beautiful day like the one I visited on, the natural light coming through these massive windows just further intensifies the vibrance of the restaurant.</p>

<p>Their menu contains most of the typical greatest hits that youâ€™d find at nearly every Mexican restaurant, nothing really stood out as a specialty that I felt I absolutely had to try. I started with a small order of queso ($3.99) to work on while I figured out what I wanted as my main dish.</p>

<p>I wonâ€™t spend too much time describing the queso. Itâ€™s delicious melted cheese, how can you go wrong there? It wasnâ€™t mixed with any sort of peppers that stood out and didnâ€™t have any kick. The only somewhat interesting thing about it was that it managed to stay rather thick while still being warm. As I mentioned in my review of <a href="https://www.kyfoodreview.com/2022/02/05/el-charro.html/" class="post-link">El Charro</a>, most quesos tend to get rather liquidy when they are hot. For someone eating solo, this is a good portion at a good price (5.5/10).</p>

<p>I ended up ordering a lunch portion of Chile Colorado as my main meal ($8.99). The dish comes with the typical sides of beans and rice with warm flour tortillas for the chileâ€™d pork. The cuts of pork itself were good though perhaps not as fall-apart as you might get with carnitas. The real star of the dish was the sauce the pork was cooked in. The first thing I noticed was that the sauce was fairly thick like you would get after letting it reduce over time. There was a nice spice to the sauce from the dried chiles that warmed the mouth without burning it while at the same time providing a good depth of flavor. The tortillas were nice but you could easily eat this without ever touching one (6.5/10).</p>

<p>El Azteca is a gorgeous restaurant where you can get some pretty good classic Mexican food. If they were to take some risks and make their menu as bold as their interior design, I think they could very easily become one of the best places to eat in Lexington.</p>
