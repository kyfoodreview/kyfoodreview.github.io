I"<p>My favorite thing about cities, like Lexington, with good food scenes, is that you can find interesting places to eat in the most unassuming places. Pasta Garage is located on a small side street off of Winchester Road near the JIF Peanut Butter factory. While not on a road many would take often, this isn’t a hole in the wall restaurant. In fact, this restaurant seems to own the entire remodeled building.</p>

<p>The asthetic can best be described as modern factory. A large chalk board with hand written menu items surrounded by drawings of small pastas and cogs immediately draws the eye towards the order window. In keeping with the “factory” look, larger cogs hang from the ceiling and are also painted on the walls and windows. It evokes an image of machines used to make streams of fresh pasta.</p>

<p>Beyond the items on the chalkboard, their menu has a wide variaty of chef’s picks and a Build Your Own dish option. I decided to go with the Ragu Alla Bolognese, an order of cheese breadsticks, and tiramisu. You are given one of those buzzer drink coasters and find a seat while you wait for your food to arrive at the Pick-Up window.</p>
