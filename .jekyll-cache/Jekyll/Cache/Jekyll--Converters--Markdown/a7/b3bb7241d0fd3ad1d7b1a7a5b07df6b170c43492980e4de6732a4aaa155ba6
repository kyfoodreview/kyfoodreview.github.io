I"¹<p>If there was one type of food I could eat for the rest of my life it would be Mexican. While I grew up on the chain-restaurant style dishes, almost always covered in cheese with sides of rice and beans, Iâ€™ve tried to expand my palate a bit more trying dishes Iâ€™m not familiar with. But sometimes you just have a craving for what you remember and El Charro hit the spot.</p>

<p>Aesthetically, El Charro is modern with their bar serving as their main focal point, but somewhat lacking in character. There are booths on the left and right walls and a fair amount of table seating between them with the bar also able to seat six. Even with a decent amount of tables the space feels too open and not very intimate.</p>

<p>With any Mexican restaurant, what will often make or break them is the chips and salsa. Iâ€™m the type of person that sometimes just wants to go and order something small so I donâ€™t feel guilty about how much free chips and salsa I want to eat. The tortilla chips here had a nice crunch and were fried well but the salsa could have been better. A bit too liquidy and had a taste of either too much oregano or cumin. I will say though that I did finish my basket of chips and salsa (5/10).</p>

<p>I hadnâ€™t planned on getting anything to drink but when I was being led to my table I noticed another customer had ordered a margarita flight and knew I had to try one ($15.00). I have no clue if they shared with the other person at their table but for its price and how much drink you get I would recommend doing just that. From left to right the flavors are Cucumber-JalapeÃ±o, Mango, Watermelon, and Pineapple. The flight also comes with a shot of tequila with a slice of orange and lime and salt and tajin.</p>

<p>The cucumber-jalapeÃ±o, which ended up being my favorite, balanced the heat from the pepper with the cool freshness from the cucumber. I could see myself ordering a regular-sized one of these. The mango was a bit too sweet and didnâ€™t taste much like fresh mango. The watermelon flavor wasnâ€™t very strong but was nice. Finally, the pineapple had some of the freshness as the cucumber but a bit of the acidity that youâ€™d normally get from pineapple. For the price, I wouldnâ€™t get it again unless I was with someone but I enjoyed it (6.5/10).</p>

<p>I decided to also get an order of queso while I waited on my lunch. Luckily they have small and regular sizes so I went with the small for $3.99. You canâ€™t ever go wrong with queso. A little runny when hot but thickens as it cools down. A small amount of kick from peppers but not too spicy (5/10).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/el-charro/enchilada.jpg" alt="Enchiladas Rancheras" class="post-img-center" /></p>

<p>For my main meal, I went with the Enchiladas Rancheras which are two cheese enchiladas topped in ranchera sauce, shredded pork, and cheese with a side of lettuce, guacamole, and rice ($11.99). The pork was tender, falling apart with a fork, the ranchera sauce had a nice smokey flavor from what I assume was chipotle pepper and the enchiladas were decent but the tortillas were a bit chewy. With the sides, the guacamole was nice and creamy with some crunch from the onion and peppers, the lettuce really didnâ€™t serve much of a point other than an optional bit of crunch to go with a bite of enchilada, and finally, the rice was fluffy though not much of a tomato flavor to it. Overall, the dish was filling with the pork being the best part (5.5/10).</p>

<p>Trying to explain places like this is difficult. Will it be the best Mexican meal youâ€™ll ever have? No. But itâ€™s a good place to get a drink, eat some chips and salsa, and have some good comfort food. Iâ€™m happy that I live pretty close to El Charro because itâ€™ll probably be the place that I go to when Iâ€™m wanting to just enjoy a meal.</p>
