I"s<p>It’s National Burger Day as I write this so I felt it was neccesary to go out and try one of Lexington’s many burger joints. Located near several of the student apartment buildings on South Broadway, Bad Wolf Burger has the feel of a mix between a place that you go to get a late night burger after a couple beers and a more classic sit-down style restaurant.</p>
