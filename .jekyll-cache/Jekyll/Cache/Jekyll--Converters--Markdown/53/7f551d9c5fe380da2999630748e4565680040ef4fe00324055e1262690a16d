<p>It was the first gorgeous spring weekend this year and I was out enjoying the day with a nice drive around Lexington. I ended up near Chinoe Road and thinking about where I might want to grab lunch I remembered there was an interesting looking Mexican restaurant with these massive windows near Kroger that I had wanted to try out for some time.</p>

<p>While Iâ€™ve certainly not yet eaten at every Mexican restaurant in Lexington, I think I can say with some confidence that this might be the best looking one in town.</p>
