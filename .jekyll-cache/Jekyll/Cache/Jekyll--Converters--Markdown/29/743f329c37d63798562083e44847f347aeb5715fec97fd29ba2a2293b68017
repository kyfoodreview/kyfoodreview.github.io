I"þ<p>Part of the reason that I began this writing endeavor was to introduce myself and hopefully you, the reader, to the new and exciting foods. As a nation of immigrants, food is often our first exposure to a countryâ€™s culture and history. Peru, much like the rest of South America, shows itâ€™s influences from Europeans to Chinese immigrants in itâ€™s dishes.</p>

<p>While not a prepared dish, I had to try what is probably Peruâ€™s second most iconic drink behind the pisco sour, an Inca Kola. Itâ€™s bright yellow color is the first thing that youâ€™ll notice about Inca Cola. There wasnâ€™t much help on the can to give me an idea of what sort of flavor it is supposed to be, but the closest thing I could compare it to would be a creme soda.</p>
