I"Æ	<p>Itâ€™s National Burger Day as I write this so I felt it was neccesary to go out and try one of Lexingtonâ€™s many burger joints. Located near several of the student apartment buildings on South Broadway, Bad Wolf Burger has the feel of a mix between a place that you go to get a late night burger after a couple beers and a more classic sit-down style restaurant.</p>

<p>For fans of the show Doctor Who like myself, yes you first thought was correct, this place clearly has some inspiration from the show. Inside, at the front door are two photos of Rose Tyler, the titular Bad Wolf from the show, as well as a mural of her holding a rose. I didnâ€™t notice until I was leaving that the drive-thru was painted to look like the outside of the police box TARDIS as well. Beyond that, there isnâ€™t much else Doctor Who kitch but I did notice some Victorian/Steam-Punk inspired wall decorations.</p>

<p>As much as that would make this place seem like a theme restaurant with plenty of puns in their menu, they keep their menu pretty straight forward with most of their burgers simply named after the whatever makes each one unique.</p>

<p>I decided to order their Barbeque Burger ($7.49) with an order of Cajun style fries ($3.99) and a soda ($2.99).</p>

<p>The Barbeque Burger is a served with a slice of aged Chedder cheese, smoked BBQ sauce, and topped with fried onion straws on a toasted bun. The burger itself was juicy and slighty above medium well with a hint of pink. I would have liked a little bit more char on the outside, which I think added more texture and flavor but the burger was good all-in-all. The cheese was a nice slice which meant that while it didnâ€™t completely melt like a slice of American cheese might it still coated the top of the burger patty well and added a nice nutty flavor which worked well with the rest of the ingredients. The BBQ sauce was thick and sweet with a bit of tang which gave a good contrast to the richness from the burger and cheese. Finally, the fried onion straws gave a nice crunch in the burger without being overwhelming like a stack of onion rings. A slightly messy burger, as most with sauces can be, it hit the spot but I feel like maybe it could have used more toppings like some bbq meat or bacon. (6.5/10)</p>
