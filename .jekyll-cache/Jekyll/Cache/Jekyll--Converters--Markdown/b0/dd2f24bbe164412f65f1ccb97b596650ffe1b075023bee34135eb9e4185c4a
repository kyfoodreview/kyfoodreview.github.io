I"A<p>When I moved back to Lexington, the first restaurant that I had dinner at was Boonedogs. I could tell immediately that this was the sort of place I would love. Lexington is a special town in that you have all the trappings of a “big” city while still being able to quickly find youself on a scenic country road; so I love the fact that a new and fun restaurant like Boonedogs would choose one of those two-lane roads to build their restaurant. Having recently announced an updated menu, I decided that another visit was in my future.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first thing you’ll notice when you park at Boonedogs is their outdoor picnic table seating section strung with lights above and a stone fire pit with wooden seats. When I arrived there were plenty of people enjoying a beautiful Spring day but I have to imagine the place looks even better in the late evening with the strings of lights illuminating everything.</p>

<p>Indoors, you’ll find a small but well distanced amount of table seating. The main point of interest is their fully stocked bar. While they call themselves a Bar and Restaurant, it always is surprising just how nice their bar is. Beyond their execelent list of beers and whiskeys, they also have a nice list of cocktails too.</p>
