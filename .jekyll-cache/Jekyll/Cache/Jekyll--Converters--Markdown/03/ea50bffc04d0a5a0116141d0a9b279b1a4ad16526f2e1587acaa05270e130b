I"}<p>If there was one type of food I could eat for the rest of my life it would be Mexican. While I grew up on the chain-restaurant style dishes, almost always covered in cheese with sides of rice and beans, I’ve tried to expand my palate a bit more trying dishes I’m not familiar with. But sometimes you just have a craving for what you remember and El Charro hit the spot.</p>
