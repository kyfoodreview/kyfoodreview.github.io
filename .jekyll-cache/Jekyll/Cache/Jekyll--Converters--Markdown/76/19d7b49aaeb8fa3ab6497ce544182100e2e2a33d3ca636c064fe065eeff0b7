I"<p>Part of the reason that I began this writing endeavor was to introduce myself and hopefully you, the reader, to the new and exciting foods. As a nation of immigrants, food is often our first exposure to a country’s culture and history. Peru, much like the rest of South America, shows it’s influences from Europeans to Chinese immigrants in it’s dishes.</p>

<p>While not a prepared dish, I had to try what is probably Peru’s second most iconic drink behind the pisco sour, an Inca Kola. It’s bright yellow color is the first thing that you’ll notice about Inca Cola. There wasn’t much help on the can to give me an idea of what sort of flavor it is supposed to be, but the closest thing I could compare it to would be a creme soda.</p>
