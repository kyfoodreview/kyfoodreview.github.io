I"<p>When I moved back to Lexington, the first restaurant that I had dinner at was Boonedogs. I could tell immediately that this was the sort of place I would love. Lexington is a special town in that you have all the trappings of a “big” city, but you are still able to quickly find youself on a scenic country road. So, I particularly love the fact that a new and fun restaurant like Boonedogs would choose one of those two-lane roads to build their restaurant.</p>
