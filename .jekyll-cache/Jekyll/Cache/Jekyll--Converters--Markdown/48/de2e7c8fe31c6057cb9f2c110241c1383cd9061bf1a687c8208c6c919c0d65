I"›<p>When I began researching all the restaurants that Lexington had to offer one thing stuck out. Where were all the Cuban restaurants? Having lived near Louisville, I had of course ate at the incredible Havana Rumba, an experience that left me wanting to explore more of this cuisine. It was much to my delight that I had found out there was a new Cuban restaurant that was just about to open it‚Äôs doors in the little strip right across from the Kroger on Richmond Road.</p>

<p>While this review was written in January, I must admit that I have already visited Hola Havana last November before I had the idea to create this website, and thus I don‚Äôt have any photos from that first visit though I will try and include my thoughts from that visit in here as well.</p>

<p>As soon as you enter you are greeted by walls of bright orange and light teal simply adorned with decorative crates and signs in Spanish. On one wall is a hand painted ‚ÄúGreetings from Havana Cuba‚Äù but the main attraction, no doubt, is the giant map of Cuba with a cute but perhaps out of place crocodile with maracas next to it.</p>
