I"×<p>Part of the reason that I began this writing endeavor was to introduce myself and hopefully you, the reader, to the new and exciting foods. As a nation of immigrants, food is often our first exposure to a countryâ€™s culture and history. Peru, much like the rest of South America, shows itâ€™s influences from Europeans to Chinese immigrants in itâ€™s dishes.</p>

<p>I arrived at Matyâ€™s pretty early, and with rain unbeknowst to me heading my way, I was unsurprisingly the only one at the restaurant. I have to imagine that closer to peak lunch rush the restaurant gets much busier. My waiter was an extremely kind young man who warmly welcomed me and took my order.</p>

<p>While not a prepared dish, I had to try what is probably Peruâ€™s second most iconic drink behind the pisco sour, an Inca Kola. Itâ€™s bright yellow color is the first thing that youâ€™ll notice about Inca Cola. There wasnâ€™t much help on the can to give me an idea of what sort of flavor it is supposed to be, but the closest thing I could compare it to would be a creme soda.</p>

<p>I decided to start with a pork tamal as my appetizer. Made with a seasoned masa, the tamal contained tender pieces of pork and a black olive. A side of sliced red onion covered in lime juice and salt and pepper served to help brighten the dish, though it certainly could stand on itâ€™s own. My kind waiter suggested I try their Aji Amirillo sauce which he said paired well with pork. The sauce was a beautiful bright yellow color and had a nice not too spicy pepper flavor close to that of perhaps a bell pepper. The tamal itself was good but I feel that it either had absorbed perhaps too much of the lime juice or just wasnâ€™t steamed as long and as a result wasnâ€™t as dense compared to a Mexican tamale, but this wasnâ€™t something that ruined the dish. Likewise, while the olive was unpitted which was a bit of a surprise. Overall it was a dish full of great flavors that I really enjoyed. (7.5/10)</p>
