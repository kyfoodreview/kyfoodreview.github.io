I"w<p>It’s National Burger Day as I write this so I felt it was necessary to go out and try one of Lexington’s many burger joints. Located near several of the student apartment buildings on South Broadway, Bad Wolf Burger has the feel of a mix between a place where you go to get a late-night burger after a couple of beers and a more classic sit-down style restaurant.</p>
