I"®<p>When I began researching all the restaurants that Lexington had to offer one thing stuck out. Where were all the Cuban restaurants? Having lived near Louisville, I had of course ate at the incredible Havana Rumba, an experience that left me wanting to explore more of this cuisine. It was much to my delight that I had found out there was a new Cuban restaurant that was just about to open it‚Äôs doors in the little strip right across from the Kroger on Richmond Road.</p>

<p>While this review was written in January, I must admit that I have already visited Hola Havana last November before I had the idea to create this website, and thus I don‚Äôt have any photos from that first visit though I will try and include my thoughts from that visit in here as well.</p>

<p>As soon as you enter you are greeted by walls of bright orange and light teal simply adorned with decorative crates and signs in Spanish. On one wall is a hand painted ‚ÄúGreetings from Havana Cuba‚Äù but the main attraction, no doubt, is the giant map of Cuba with a cute but perhaps out of place crocodile with maracas next to it.</p>

<p>There is a mixture of booth seating along the window and table seating throughout the restaurant. On the back wall of the restaurant sits a small bar with seven seats and several TVs above. The space itself somewhat small but it allows the owner and wait staff to spend more time interacting with customers giving it a more warm personal feel. The sort of place that if you ate there a handful of times you‚Äôd probably be treated as a regular.</p>

<p>As an appetizer, I ordered ham and chicken croquettes served with a creamy chipotle sauce ($7.99). The mixture of ham and chicken was a bit too fine and never really allowed one meat‚Äôs flavor to stick out. I would have liked it if there were noticible pieces of diced ham or shredded chicken both for texture and taste. That being said, the croquettes were perfectly fried with crust that wasn‚Äôt too heavy but still able to keep everything together.</p>
